# pid-playground
A collection of python-based exercises teaching common methods of Particle IDentification (PID). PID is the process of identifying particles present in the raw data released by particle physics experiments. After PID, the data can be used for hadron spectroscopy, as described in other resources such as Particle Physics Playground.
